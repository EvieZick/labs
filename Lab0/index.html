        <h2>Communications Major</h2>
        <p>I'm currently a 4th year student with a communications major and multimedia communications minor. I'm currently an intern at Barr Engineering where I've been working on creating graphic content. I'm hoping to go into graphic design, but I'm not really sure yet.</p>
        <h4>My Favorite Things</h4>
        <p>I'd consider myself a pretty active / outdoorsy person! I love backpacking, hiking, and camping. I have a pretty cool partner who is an experienced setter, so we like to do outdoor climbing together. It's taken us on some pretty cool ventures! I'm also an avid walker, and I love walking around the neighborhood with my camera and doing photography. I enjoy drawing and writing music and most other things that help me flex my creative muscles.</p>
