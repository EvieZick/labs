    <h2>There are over 300 breeds of pigeons.</h2>
    <h3>I bet you didn't know that.</h3>
        <p>Pigeons are highly versatile and can be bred in many different ways. Because of this, there are over 300 breeds of "fancy" pigeons. These conglomerations of crazy traits wield some wild, wacky, and wonderous winged wonders. <br> For nearly each breed of pigeons, there are more subdivisions. For example, there are many many different types of pouter pigeons, and many many different types of tumbler pigeons. Basically any network of genes you can incorperate into this fantastic feathered canvas, it has been done. <br> However, this has led to some extreme inbreeding, such as the fantail pigeon and owl pigeons. Pigeons are wonderful, smart, and diverse birds, but excessive breeding has rendered some pigeons incapable of surviving the rough-and-tumble city life.</p>
