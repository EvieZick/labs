    <p>The domestic pigeon is a subspecies that was derived from the rock dove, or rock pigeon. The rock pigeon is the world's oldest domesticated bird, and now nearly all pigeons throughout the world are feral. <br> Pigeons have been bred by people for specific purposes, and then unfortunately largely discarded. They have been used for messages (homing pigeons), racing (racing homers), and poultry (king pigeons). <br> Because pigeons are essentially a bird of human creation, these feathered familiars depend on us, although we may not know it.</p>
    <h3>Dove vs. Pigeon</h3>
    <img src="images/p-d.jpg" class="image-only">
    <p>What's the difference? There are few differenciating features between doves and pigeons. In fact, the white "doves" released at weddings and magic shows...are usually pigeons. The main difference is that doves are typically smaller than pigeons, but aside from that, they are similar in terms of sounds, calls, and behaviors. <br> Neither know how to make a nest. </p>
