        There are tons of really cool different types of rocks. A lot of people don't know how truly awesome rocks are. <br> There are tons of different shapes, formations, and sizes of rocks.
        That pebble you're eyeing up? <br> Yeah. That might've been a mountain before dinosaurs even existed. Soooo basically, rocks are dope.

    <h2>The Process of a Pebble</h2>

    <p>
        Pebbles come in various colors and textures and can have streaks, known as veins, of quartz or other minerals. <br> Pebbles are mostly smooth but, dependent on how frequently they come in contact with the sea, they can have marks of contact with other rocks or other pebbles. <br> Pebbles left above the high water mark may have growths of organisms such as lichen on them, signifying the lack of contact with seawater.

    <h2>Erosion</h2>

    <p>
        Erosion is the geological process in which earthen materials are worn away and transported by natural forces such as wind or water. A similar process, weathering, breaks down or dissolves rock, but does not involve movement. 
        <br>Erosion is the opposite of deposition, the geological process in which earthen materials are deposited, or built up, on a landform. <br> Most erosion is performed by liquid water, wind, or ice (usually in the form of a glacier). If the wind is dusty, or water or glacial ice is muddy, erosion is taking place. <br> The brown color indicates that bits of rock and soil are suspended in the fluid (air or water) and being transported from one place to another. This transported material is called sediment.
