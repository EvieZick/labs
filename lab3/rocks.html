    <h2>I've always loved rocks.</h2>
    <p>Some of my first vivid memories are picking up rounded stones off of the beaches of lake superior, or sifting through the rocks under the deck in my backyard. 
        <br> I would sort and categorize rocks into different categories, igneous, sedimentary, and metemorphic. 
        <br> I have always loved all rocks, but in my eyes, all rocks are NOT created equal. Some are way cooler, basically.

    <h3>Rose quartz</h3>

    <p>Like other types of quartz, most rose quartz is formed through the process of magma crystallization, making magmatic pegmatites the primary source of larger rose quartz crystals. <br> However, this is not the only possible method of formation, as this mineral can also be found in hydrothermal veins.</p>
    <p>I have found some pretty cool chunks of rose quartz in my day.</p>
<h3>Agate</h3>  
<img src="images/Agate.jpg" alt="Agate" width="300">
<p>An agate crystal forms within the cavities of other rocks in acidic to neutral environments. <br> Its formation occurs by the accumulation of silica-rich groundwater in rock voids, over thousands of years. In fact, these chalcedony veins mostly develop within the voids of volcanic igneous rocks and plutonic igneous rocks.</p>  
<p>Very cool.</p>
<h3>Geode</h3>
<img src="images/Geode.jpg" alt="geode" width="300">
<p>When I was a kid, I remember buying geodes from the Black Hills in South Dakota and screaming in glee when I smashed them open with a hammer. <br> I was so excited to see the sparkling crystals line the inside of an otherwise unsuspecting rock.</p>
<p>Geodes are formed when there are pockets of air within rocks. This often happens after volcanic eruptions when lava cools around air bubbles. <br> These pockets leave space for groundwater to seep in. <br> But the water itself doesn't produce geodesâ€“it brings along minerals which stay in the rock even after the water evaporates.</p>
<h3>Crystals</h3>
<p>All of the listed rocks are crystals, but I need a list. So here are some more cool crystals.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Citrine</li>
    <li>Tourmaline</li>
    <li>Carnelian</li>
    <li>Amber</li>
    <li>Flourite</li>
</ul>>
