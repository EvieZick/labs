            Hi, I'm Evie! I'm a fourth year student at the University of Wisconsin, Eau Claire studying communications with a multimedia minor. I currently work as a communications intern at Barr Engineering Co., where I am working to gain hands-on experience in internal and external content creation, social media, and graphic design.
            I also currently serve as an Academic Assistant for an upper division multimedia design class. In this role, I help students find creative approaches to visual design using Adobe suites. Additionally, I assist in course planning and host out-of-class office hours for student drop-ins.
            <br>
            My passions include visual arts and design, writing, environmental justice and conservation, and solution-based storytelling.
