            <article><h3>New Study Finds Americans Scoot Over At Least 10 Miles Per Year</h3>
            <p>WASHINGTON—A new study published Wednesday by the 
                Department of Transportation reveals that the average U.S. 
                resident travels some 10 miles annually solely through the 
                act of scooting over to make room for another person. 
                “Between park benches, bleachers, backseats, and various 
                other types of shared, communal seating, the typical American scoots nearly a mile a month,” said Department Secretary Anthony Foxx, who added that, taken all together, a 
                lifetime’s worth of scooting over, sliding over, scooching, and 
                “making a bit more room” would equal the distance from the 
                nation’s capital to Orlando, FL. “The statistics are even 
                higher in the South, where picnic season is longer. And if you 
                count instances of scooting over, seeing the other person 
                has already found a place, and then scooting back, many 
                Americans travel farther by scooting than they do by motor 
                vehicle.” The study’s methodology has come under fire from critics who argue it should have also counted situations in which sitters must 
                move their chair over to make room for someone who already has their own chair. </p>

            <p>The Onion September 19, 2019 Nike Recalls Sweat-Wicking Shirts That Pulled Gallons Of Liquid Directly From Wearers' Bodies BEAVERTON, OR" Warning customers to return the garments should they find themselves being drained of all fluids, Nike recalled thousands of sweat-wicking shirts Tuesday that inadvertently pulled gallons of liquid directly from wearers' bodies. If you or anyone you know puts on a Legend Dri-FIT short-sleeve training shirt and then immediately shrivels into a dried, wrinkled husk, please contact Nike for a full refund, said spokeswoman Jessica Garland, who apologized directly to customers who purchased a moisture-wicking shirt, only to have every ounce of sweat, urine, and blood sucked out of their body. You may think it's okay to wear these shirts for a routine workout at the gym, but be warned after five minutes of use, you could lose up to 40 pounds of water weight. Even if you wear it to sleep, you could wake up as nothing but a pile of desiccated flesh lying in a puddle. At press time, Nike was forced to issue a second apology after news broke of a million-dollar lawsuit alleging their compression tops had crushed the torsos of athletes into an infinitesimally small speck of dust. </p>

            <p>The Onion July 25, 2019 Tom Hanks Recalls Arriving On A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood Set At Dawn For Grueling 6-Hour Cardigan-Application Process LOS ANGELES Saying the process called for incredible patience, Tom Hanks, who stars as Fred Rogers in the forthcoming A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood, recalled Tuesday having to arrive on the set of the film before dawn each day for a grueling, six-hour cardigan application process. I was always at the trailer by 5 a.m. so the cardigan artist and his team of eight assistants could spend the entire morning applying the sweater, said the two-time Academy Award winner, adding that it was incredibly difficult to act in the unwieldy garment, as it was very itchy and the chemicals used to apply it often burned his skin. We were working with the top cardigan guy in Hollywood, and he spent months taking molds of my torso so he could build a sweater that would look as realistic as possible on screen. I love how it turned out, but boy, all that time spent holding perfectly still in the chair can wear you down, especially when you consider it took them an additional three hours to apply my tie. At press time, sources close to the actor confirmed Hanks was furious after learning the studio had decided to go with a CGI sweater. </p>
